# String-Character-Counter
<h1>Letter Frequency Table</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This program takes an input of string from the user and counts how many characters are represented and repeated
this table is printed with 2 rows of 13 columns representing the alphabet respectively in order. After the table is printed the user is asked 
if they want to try again if the user enters 1 then all the registers are zeroed out and the program starts again from the top,
if any other register is entered then the program exits.

Once the user presses enter or reaches 100 characters, the code removes everything but the letters and counts how many times it sees each letter printing it in a table: <br/>
