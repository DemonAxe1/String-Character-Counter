String Character Counter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Main idea:
----------
This program takes an input of string from the user and counts how many characters are represented and repeated
this table is printed with 2 rows of 13 columns representing the alphabet respectively in order. After the table is printed the user is asked 
if they want to try again if the user enters 1 then all the registers are zeroed out and the program starts again from the top,
if any other register is entered then the program exits.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User input:
---------------
The user is prompted with the title of the program and a short description then is asked to input a 100-character long
string or shorter. Once the 100 characters are entered or the user presses enter then the program prompts and print 
the table with all the timeâ€™s characters repeated. 
After the table, the user is prompted to repeat the program or exit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checking the input and converting it:
----------------------------
Once the string input is entered the program manipulated the string removing anything that is not a capital or lowercase letter,
turning all the capital letters into lower case. Once we have the new manipulated string with only characters we check each character and add one 
to a position in an array that represents all 26 letters of the alphabet. Once we went through the whole new string we print the table that shows 
how many times any character was found. 
The user is prompted to enter the integer 1 to run the program again, if any other integer is pressed then the program prints
a thank you message and exits
